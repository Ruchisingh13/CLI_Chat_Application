# CLI_Chat_Application
ðŸ“„ Description: Using Python and UDP sockets, I created a basic chat application with a command-line interface (CLI). Through the use of this project, users will be able to send and receive messages across a network, with each message received being recorded along with its sender's IP address, date, and time of receipt.
